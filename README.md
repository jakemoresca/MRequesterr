[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=jakemoresca_MRequesterr&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=jakemoresca_MRequesterr)

MRequesterr is an application that can be hosted statically on sites like Vercel, Azure Storage, etc. It can be configured for now by using Environment Variables to connect to your own Sonarr, Radarr, and Jellyfin instance.

#### **Features:**
	Sonarr - Manage requests, view release calendar, view current library.
	Radarr - Manage requests, view release calendar, view current library.
	Tmdb - Discover new content, content search.
	Jellyfin - Used for login. On future releases, we will add new login mechanism (Plex, Emby, Auth0, etc.)
	Static hosting - No need for servers, any html hosting should work with proper configuration.

#### Deployment
